## How to apply

### Submission system

Submit electronically via the **CTU Research Information System** (university-hosted submission portal):

- online form for metadata, and  
- secure document upload area for proposal \+ annexes..

### Technical failures / late submission

If a technical issue prevents timely submission, contact call administration **without undue delay**. In exceptional justified cases, administration may accept submissions outside the portal (must be recorded and time-stamped). Unsolicited documents delivered outside the portal are not considered official. 

## How proposals are evaluated

### Principles and workflow

Evaluation is performed by an expert panel, typically in rounds:

1) Eligibility/completeness check  
2) Panel document-based assessment and shortlisting  
3) External peer reviews  
4) Structured interview for shortlisted applicants  
5) Final ranking and funding recommendation

The panel may shortlist at most **20 proposals** for interviews. 

### Criteria and weights

- **A (40%)** Scientific quality and originality of the project  
- **B (40%)** Excellence, independence, and leadership potential of the PI  
- **C (20%)** Feasibility of implementation at CTU (fit; host environment; implementation risks/support plan)

Budget adequacy is **not** a primary scored criterion; budget checks/adjustments are performed mainly after shortlisting and in negotiations.

### On-line interviews (ERC-style)

- PI presentation: up to **5 minutes** (objectives, approach, risks/mitigations, independence/leadership plan)  
- Q\&A and discussion: up to **20 minutes**  
- Closed panel deliberation without applicant.  
  Invitations are sent at least **10 calendar days** in advance; one rescheduling may be allowed for serious reasons if feasible and fair. 

### Interview recording and retention

Interviews are **not recorded by default**. Any recording (if agreed in advance) is for internal documentation only and will be retained only up to **90 days after results publication**, then securely deleted. 

## Results, negotiations, and project start

### Panel outcome and decision

The panel adopts a **final ranking** and funding recommendation (including any recommended budget adjustments). Funding is conditional on successful negotiations and a formal host unit co-funding commitment documented in the grant agreement. Negotiations are initiated strictly **in ranking order**. 

### Grant agreement (what it must include)

The grant agreement between CTU, host unit(s), and PI covers:

- start date (within the start window),  
- funding shares, any approved relocation, and any agreed FTE flexibility,  
- conditions for any approved bridging extension, and  
- **employment and career-path arrangements for the PI** (as a condition of funding award). 

## Guidance for referees and panel members

### For external referees (what you will be asked to do)

External reviewers provide written, criteria-based assessments using the template issued with the call; they assess proposals individually (no ranking) and must decline if a conflict of interest occurs. 

### For panel members (core rules)

- Panel is an advisory body; final decisions follow the programme governance.  
- Chair/Vice-Chair roles, rapporteur assignment, and documented deliberation are defined in the panel rules. 

### Confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and “do not do” list

- All proposals/reviews/scores/discussions/rankings are strictly confidential and must be handled only in CTU-approved secure environments.  
- Evaluators must **not** upload/share application content with external services that store/reuse/train on data (including generative AI tools and online translation services).   
- Evaluators must not do general web searches about applicants; bibliographic databases may be used only to clarify specific outputs.   
- Conflicts of interest must be declared promptly; conflicted members do not act as rapporteurs, do not participate in discussion/scoring/ranking/reporting, and leave the room/disconnect for the relevant agenda item. 

## FAQs

**What is the purpose of the CVUT Starting Grant?**

The CVUT Starting Grant is designed to help excellent early-career researchers establish new independent research groups at Czech Technical University in Prague and to strengthen their academic profile through institutional employment and career-path arrangements negotiated after selection.

Awarded projects run for up to 3 years, with a possible exceptional extension of up to 1 additional year, typically in the form of bridging funding, subject to approval and without an automatic increase in funding volume.

**Can I submit more than one proposal to this call?**

No. Only one proposal per applicant is allowed in this call, and each researcher may receive CVUT Starting Grant support only once over their career.

**How is the “8 years after PhD” eligibility window calculated?**

The 8-year window is calculated from the official PhD award date to the submission deadline. Documented career breaks (e.g. parental leave, long-term illness, military service) may extend this window as defined in the call text. Applicants must clearly document and justify any such extensions in their application.

**I already work at CTU. Am I still eligible?**

Yes. Researchers already employed at CTU may apply, provided they meet all eligibility criteria, including career stage and international experience, and can commit an appropriate FTE for the project duration.

**Is relocation to Prague required to apply?**

No. Relocation is not required to apply. However, funded projects require an agreed CTU employment arrangement and a level of physical presence sufficient to ensure effective project implementation. A one-time relocation package is available for PIs moving from abroad, subject to the rules defined in the call.

**What does “international experience” mean in practice?**

Applicants must meet at least one of the following criteria before the submission deadline: PhD awarded by a foreign research university, or a minimum of 12 consecutive months of full-time postdoctoral experience abroad (employment or competitive fellowship). Short visits, conference travel, or split stays do not fulfill this requirement. Interpretation of eligibility criteria in non-standard cases is handled by the call administration. Applicants with questions are advised to seek clarification prior to submission.

**Does the thematic area I select limit my research topic?**

No. The thematic areas (ENG, MIN, ASH) are used solely for organisational purposes, such as assigning appropriate reviewers and rapporteurs. They do not constrain the scientific scope or interdisciplinarity of your proposal.

**How important is the budget in the evaluation?**

Budget size is not a scored evaluation criterion. Reviewers focus primarily on: scientific quality and originality, the PI’s excellence, independence, and leadership potential, and feasibility of implementation at CTU. Budget checks and possible adjustments are addressed mainly after shortlisting and during post-selection negotiations.

**Can I request less than a 1.0 FTE appointment?**

Yes, in justified cases. Reduced FTE arrangements may be approved if they are compatible with effective project implementation and are explicitly agreed during negotiations and recorded in the grant agreement.

**What happens if my proposal is ranked but negotiations fail?**

Funding offers are made strictly in ranking order and are conditional on successful post-selection negotiations. If negotiations cannot be concluded within the call timeline, the funding offer may be withdrawn, and the panel recommendation does not automatically carry over to a future call.

**When will my project start?**

Projects may start at any time up to 12 months after signing the grant agreement and are expected to start as soon as practicable. Later start dates must be well justified and agreed during negotiations. Earlier starts are possible once all formal conditions are fulfilled.
