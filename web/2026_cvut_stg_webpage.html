<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>CVUT Starting Grant</strong> supports excellent
early-career researchers in building <strong>new independent research
groups</strong> at Czech Technical University in Prague. The competition
has <strong>two phases</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Competitive scientific selection</strong> resulting in a
ranked list of proposals;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Post-selection negotiations</strong> on institutional
conditions, leading to a <strong>grant agreement</strong>.<br />
Funding offers can be withdrawn if negotiations cannot be concluded
within the call timeline.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="thematic-areas-organisational-routing-only">Thematic areas

<li><strong>MIN</strong>: Mathematics, Informatics, and Natural
Sciences<br />

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of the CVUT Starting Grant?</strong></p>
<p>The CVUT Starting Grant is designed to help excellent early-career
researchers establish new independent research groups at Czech Technical
University in Prague and to strengthen their academic profile through
institutional employment and career-path arrangements negotiated after
selection.</p>
<p>Awarded projects run for up to 3 years, with a possible exceptional
extension of up to 1 additional year, typically in the form of bridging
funding, subject to approval and without an automatic increase in
funding volume.</p>
<p><strong>Can I submit more than one proposal to this
call?</strong></p>
<p>No. Only one proposal per applicant is allowed in this call, and each
researcher may receive CVUT Starting Grant support only once over their
career.</p>
<p><strong>How is the “8 years after PhD” eligibility window
calculated?</strong></p>
<p>The 8-year window is calculated from the official PhD award date to
the submission deadline. Documented career breaks (e.g. parental leave,
long-term illness, military service) may extend this window as defined
in the call text. Applicants must clearly document and justify any such
extensions in their application.</p>
<p><strong>I already work at CTU. Am I still eligible?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Researchers already employed at CTU may apply, provided they
meet all eligibility criteria, including career stage and international
experience, and can commit an appropriate FTE for the project
duration.</p>
<p><strong>Is relocation to Prague required to apply?</strong></p>
<p>No. Relocation is not required to apply. However, funded projects
require an agreed CTU employment arrangement and a level of physical
presence sufficient to ensure effective project implementation. A
one-time relocation package is available for PIs moving from abroad,
subject to the rules defined in the call.</p>
<p><strong>What does “international experience” mean in
practice?</strong></p>
<p>Applicants must meet at least one of the following criteria before
the submission deadline: PhD awarded by a foreign research university,
or a minimum of 12 consecutive months of full-time postdoctoral
experience abroad (employment or competitive fellowship). Short visits,
conference travel, or split stays do not fulfill this requirement.
Interpretation of eligibility criteria in non-standard cases is handled
by the call administration. Applicants with questions are advised to
seek clarification prior to submission.</p>
<p><strong>Does the thematic area I select limit my research
topic?</strong></p>
<p>No. The thematic areas (ENG, MIN, ASH) are used solely for
organisational purposes, such as assigning appropriate reviewers and
rapporteurs. They do not constrain the scientific scope or
interdisciplinarity of your proposal.</p>
<p><strong>How important is the budget in the evaluation?</strong></p>
<p>Budget size is not a scored evaluation criterion. Reviewers focus
primarily on: scientific quality and originality, the PI’s excellence,
independence, and leadership potential, and feasibility of
implementation at CTU. Budget checks and possible adjustments are
addressed mainly after shortlisting and during post-selection
negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Can I request less than a 1.0 FTE appointment?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in justified cases. Reduced FTE arrangements may be approved if
they are compatible with effective project implementation and are
explicitly agreed during negotiations and recorded in the grant
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if my proposal is ranked but negotiations
fail?</strong></p>
<p>Funding offers are made strictly in ranking order and are conditional
on successful post-selection negotiations. If negotiations cannot be
concluded within the call timeline, the funding offer may be withdrawn,
and the panel recommendation does not automatically carry over to a
future call.</p>
<p><strong>When will my project start?</strong></p>
<p>Projects may start at any time up to 12 months after signing the
grant agreement and are expected to start as soon as practicable. Later
start dates must be well justified and agreed during negotiations.
Earlier starts are possible once all formal conditions are
fulfilled.</p>
