## Overview
The **CVUT Starting Grant** supports excellent early-career researchers in building **new independent research directions** at CTU. The competition has **two phases**:
1) **Competitive scientific selection** resulting in a ranked list of proposals;  
2) **Post-selection negotiations** on institutional conditions, leading to a **grant agreement**.  
Funding offers can be withdrawn if negotiations cannot be concluded within the call timeline. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Thematic areas (organisational routing only)
For organising expertise and rapporteur assignment, proposals are routed to one area (this does **not** constrain scientific scope):
- **ENG** — Engineering and Technology  
- **MIN** — Mathematics, Informatics, and Natural Sciences  
- **ASH** — Arts, Social Sciences, and Humanities (with clear relevance to CTU’s profile) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## How to apply
### Submission system
Submit electronically via the **CTU Research Information System** (university-hosted submission portal):
- online form for metadata, and  
- secure document upload area for proposal + annexes.  
A submission is complete once the portal issues an **automatic timestamped confirmation**. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}

### Technical failures / late submission
If a technical issue prevents timely submission, contact call administration **without undue delay**. In exceptional justified cases, administration may accept submissions outside the portal (must be recorded and time-stamped). Unsolicited documents delivered outside the portal are not considered official. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

---

## How proposals are evaluated
### Principles and workflow
Evaluation is comparative, evidence-based, and performed by an expert panel, typically in rounds:
1) Eligibility/completeness check  
2) Panel document-based assessment and shortlisting  
3) External peer reviews  
4) Structured interview for shortlisted applicants  
5) Final ranking and funding recommendation :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}

The panel may shortlist at most **20 proposals** for interviews. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

### Criteria and weights
- **A (40%)** Scientific quality and originality of the project  
- **B (40%)** Excellence, independence, and leadership potential of the PI  
- **C (20%)** Feasibility of implementation at CTU (fit; host environment; implementation risks/support plan)  
Budget adequacy is **not** a primary scored criterion; budget checks/adjustments are performed mainly after shortlisting and in negotiations. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

### Scoring scale
Criteria and overall are scored on **1–9** (9 Outstanding … 1 Poor). The overall score is **not** a mechanical average. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

### Interviews (ERC-style)
- PI presentation: up to **5 minutes** (objectives, approach, risks/mitigations, independence/leadership plan)  
- Q&A and discussion: up to **20 minutes**  
- Closed panel deliberation without applicant.  
Invitations are sent at least **10 calendar days** in advance; one rescheduling may be allowed for serious reasons if feasible and fair. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}

### Interview recording and retention
Interviews are **not recorded by default**. Any recording (if agreed in advance) is for internal documentation only and is retained until **90 days after results publication**, then securely deleted. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}

---

## Results, negotiations, and project start
### Panel outcome and decision
The panel adopts a **final ranking** and funding recommendation (including any recommended budget adjustments). Funding is conditional on successful negotiations and a formal host unit co-funding commitment documented in the grant agreement. Negotiations are initiated strictly **in ranking order**. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}

### Grant agreement (what it must include)
The grant agreement between CTU, host unit(s), and PI covers:
- start date (within the start window),  
- funding shares, any approved relocation, and any agreed FTE flexibility,  
- conditions for any approved bridging extension, and  
- **employment and career-path arrangements for the PI** (as a condition of award). :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}

---

## Requests for review (procedural)
You may request a review if you believe:
- the proposal was incorrectly assessed as ineligible/inadmissible/incomplete; or  
- the evaluation procedure was not correctly applied (e.g., procedural irregularity, COI handling, missing material).  

A request cannot challenge scientific judgement. It must be submitted within **5 calendar days** of receiving the results notification (via the submission system, or as instructed if unavailable). It is examined by a Rectorate-appointed committee not involved in the evaluation. Possible outcomes include confirmation, correction of formal status (and continuation where feasible), or other proportionate procedural remedies. :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}

## Guidance for referees and panel members
*(This section is included so you can share the same link when inviting reviewers/panelists.)*

### For external referees (what you will be asked to do)
External reviewers provide written, criteria-based assessments using the template issued with the call; they assess proposals individually (no ranking) and must decline if conflicted. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}

### For panel members (core rules)
- Panel is an advisory body; final decisions follow the programme governance.  
- Chair/Vice-Chair roles, rapporteur assignment, and documented deliberation are defined in the panel rules. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}

### Confidentiality, conflicts of interest, and “do not do” list
- All proposals/reviews/scores/discussions/rankings are strictly confidential and must be handled only in CTU-approved secure environments. :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}
- Evaluators must **not** upload/share application content with external services that store/reuse/train on data (including generative AI tools and online translation services). :contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}
- Evaluators must not do general web searches about applicants; bibliographic databases may be used only to clarify specific outputs. :contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}
- Conflicts must be declared promptly; conflicted members do not act as rapporteurs, do not participate in discussion/scoring/ranking/reporting, and leave the room/disconnect for the relevant agenda item. :contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}
