Rector's Directive No. \[xx\]/\[20xx\]

# Principles of the ČVUT Starting Grant Competition at the Czech Technical University in Prague

## Article I: General Provisions
1. The Czech Technical University in Prague (hereinafter the "University" or "CTU") hereby establishes the **"ČVUT
    Starting Grant"** competition (hereinafter, the "Competition"), in accordance with the [Strategic Plan CTU 2021+](https://www.cvut.cz/sites/default/files/content/8b6ab1e1-c0aa-4b1c-a90a-f06eab2d7b7f/en/20210426-strategy-of-ctu-2021.pdf).

2. The Competition is designed as a **two-phase process**:
    1. a competitive **scientific selection** resulting in a ranked list of proposals; and
    2. post-selection **negotiations and host matching**, resulting in agreed institutional conditions of project implementation.
    To streamline the process, **non-binding host-matching** may be carried out **after shortlisting** to prepare post-selection negotiations; it **does not constitute a host commitment** and **does not affect evaluation or ranking**.

3. The ČVUT Starting Grant aims to support **excellent early-career researchers** (typically those with considerable international experience or recently returned from abroad) in establishing **new independent research groups** at CTU, with the award coupled to an agreed **assistant professor tenure-track position** and related career-path arrangements.

4. The scheme promotes **open recruitment** by prioritising candidates who bring substantial experience from **outside their intended CTU host unit** (i.e., the participating CTU faculty or institute hosting the project). Accordingly, the scheme does not provide additional funding to established research groups; it is intended to support the establishment of new independent groups led by the PI.

5. As a **condition of award**, post-selection negotiations must result in a **grant agreement concluded between CTU**, the relevant **host unit(s)**, and the **Principal Investigator (PI)**. The grant agreement must include the agreed employment and career-path arrangements for the PI together with any related employment documentation.

## Article II: Eligibility and Competition Conditions

1. **Eligibility**. A PI:
    1. **may not**, at the time of submission, be a member of an evaluation panel established under **Article V** of this Directive; and
    2. **may receive** support under the ČVUT Starting Grant **only once**.

2. **Thematic areas**. Proposals are submitted to thematic areas aligned with the main scientific domains of CTU, as specified in the annual call.

3. **Submission system**. Proposals must be submitted electronically, in the manner and within the deadlines specified in the annual call.

4. **Project team composition**
    1. The core of the project team is the **PI**, who must:
        1. have been awarded their first Ph.D. (or equivalent) no more than eight (8) years before the call deadline; documented career breaks may be excluded from this limit as specified in the annual call;
        2. **demonstrate substantial international experience** by meeting at least one of the following conditions prior to the Calldeadline:
            1. a Ph.D. award (or equivalent) obtained at a **foreign research university**, in a field **relevant to the proposed project** or demonstrably connected to the PI’s **research trajectory leading to the project**; or
            2. a postdoctoral stay abroad, defined as full-time employment in a postdoctoral position at a foreign research institution for at least **twelve (12) consecutive months**, funded by employment or a competitive fellowship.

            Other forms of mobility (e.g., short visits) do not satisfy this requirement. Any exception must be explicitly justified in the panel report.
        3. be employed by CTU for the duration of the project at an full-time equivalent (FTE) enabling **effective project** implementation (**normally 1.0 FTE**). In justified cases (e.g., parental leave, caring responsibilities, or other serious circumstances), a reduced FTE may be agreed in the grant agreement, typically together with a corresponding adjustment of the project timeline;
        4. comply with applicable CTU rules on outside professional activities and conflicts of interest; standard academic and professional service is generally compatible.
    2. The team may further include:[^1]
        1. doctoral students enrolled in CTU doctoral study programmes;
        2. CTU postdoctoral researchers;
        3. Master's (and where appropriate, Bachelor's) students; and
        4. CTU technical and specialist staff.

        The composition of the research team may be modified during the project in accordance with the grant agreement and CTU internal rules.

5. **Project duration and start date**
    1. The project start date may be **set or deferred upon justified request** within a window specified in the annual Calland the grant agreement (e.g., relocation, visa procedures, or comparable circumstances).
    2. The maximum project **duration is three (3) years**.
    3. An **exceptional extension** of **up to one (1) additional year** may be granted once, primarily as a **bridging** or **continuity mechanism**, under conditions specified in the annual Calland the grant agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the extension is **no-cost** (does not increase the approved funding volume).

6. **Participation in other grant competitions**. A PI whose ČVUT Starting Grant project is funded may apply for and hold **other external grants during the project period.** Submission of an **European Research Council (ERC) Starting or Consolidator Grant** (or equivalent) proposal no **later than one (1) year** after the end of the ČVUT Starting Grant project is expected. Additional compatibility rules may be specified in the annual call.

7. Applicants who are unsuccessful in a given Callmay **reapply** in subsequent calls, subject to any per-Callsubmission limits specified in the annual call.

## Article III: Financial Framework
1. **Sources and structure of funding**
    1. Financial resources for ČVUT Starting Grant projects are provided primarily from the CTU Future Fund and from the budgets of the host units.
    2. Project funds are divided into the following categories:
        1. **personnel costs,** including the PI’s and team members’ salaries, Ph.D. student stipends, and work activity agreements for Master's and Bachelor's students;
        2. **operational costs, travel, and services,** including eligible child/dependent-care costs;
        3. **investment costs (capital expenditure)** for the acquisition of long-term tangible and intangible assets; and
        4. **overhead costs** up to **20%** of eligible direct costs, calculated on eligible direct cost excluding investment costs.
        
2. **Annual cap, co-funding, and relocation support**
    1. The maximum amount that may be requested per year (the "**annual cap**") is specified in the annual call.
    2. The standard **co-funding ratio** is specified in the annual call. Any deviations from the default ratio, including their conditions and limits, are **defined in the annual call** and **confirmed in post-selection negotiations** between the Rectorate, the relevant Dean/Director, and the PI, and documented in the grant agreement.
    3. For PIs moving from abroad, the annual Callmay provide a **one-time relocation package**, with the maximum amount and eligible cost items specified in the annual call. Where provided, the relocation package is funded **at 100%** by the CTU Future Fund and is documented in the grant agreement.
3. **Carry-over and unused funds**. Flexible carry-over of an **objectively justified amount** is encouraged, in particular to accommodate hiring and onboarding timelines.

## Article IV: Project Proposal
1. Each proposal includes a **scientific description**, the **PI's track record** (including ongoing grants and thematic links), an **indicative budget**, and a description of the **intended host environment**, as specified in the annual call.

2. The proposal **must be supported by two (2)** structured **recommendation letters** supporting the PI's **excellence** and **independence**. The annual Callspecifies their format and submission method.

3. Applicants are encouraged to contact potential host units in advance and may indicate an **intended host**; however, **host matching and the confirmation of institutional commitments take place in post-selection negotiations**, and no employment or tenure commitment is required at the time of submission.

## Article V: Evaluation of Proposals

    1. Proposals are evaluated by **an expert evaluation panel** appointed by the Rector.
    2. The Rector appoints a **Chair** responsible for convening and chairing panel meetings and for overseeing the proper conduct of the evaluation process.
    3. The composition and operation of the panel are governed by a separate Rector's directive or by the annual call.
    4. The panel should include **external members** from outside CTU, including **international experts** where feasible. The annual Callmay define thematic areas aligned with CTU's main
        scientific domains for organizational purposes (e.g., allocation of rapporteurs and external expertise).

2. **Evaluation criteria**
    1. For each proposal, the panel assesses in particular:
        1. scientific quality and originality;
        2. excellence, independence, and leadership potential of the PI;
