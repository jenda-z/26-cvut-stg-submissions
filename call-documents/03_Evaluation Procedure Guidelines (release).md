Rector's Directive No. [\[xx\]/\[20xx\]]

# Evaluation Procedure Guidelines for ČVUT Starting Grant

## Article I: Introductory provisions

1.  This Directive establishes the **evaluation panel** for the ČVUT Starting Grant competition (the **Competition**) at the Czech Technical University in Prague (the **University** or **CTU**) and sets out the **core evaluation procedure**, roles, safeguards, and documentation requirements.
2.  The evaluation panel is an **expert advisory body of the Rector**. The evaluation is carried out in accordance with:
    1.  the **Principles of the ČVUT Starting Grant Competition** (the **Principles**);
    2.  the relevant **annual Call for proposals** (the **Call**); and
    3.  internal regulations of the University and applicable legal regulations.
3.  **Hierarchy of documents.** This Directive constitutes the **Evaluation Procedure Guidelines** referred to in the Principles. It therefore does not repeat programme principles, eligibility rules, or the evaluation criteria and scoring definitions published in the Call. In case of conflict, the **Principles** and the **Call** prevail.
4.  **Thematic areas (organizational routing only).** For organizational purposes (allocation of rapporteurs and external expertise), each proposal is assigned to one thematic area aligned with CTU's main scientific domains, as specified in the Call. This assignment:
    1.  does **not** create separate evaluation panels; and
    2.  does **not** constrain the scientific scope of eligible proposals.
5. **Host-unit matching (non-interference).** Any host-unit matching and post-selection negotiations are carried out **outside the evaluation panel process** and **must not influence** panel deliberations **beyond the published evaluation criteria**. This does not limit the panel’s assessment of feasibility at the intended host environment **as described in the proposal** under the published criteria.
6.  **Workload allocation parameters.** Unless stated otherwise in the Call, the following workload-allocation defaults apply:
    1.  each **admitted** proposal is assigned to **one primary rapporteur** for Stage 1; 
    2.  after shortlisting, each **shortlisted** proposal is assigned to **one additional panel member** as a **co-rapporteur**;
    3. for proposals designated as **interdisciplinary** (as decided by the Chair in consultation with the secretariat), a **second co-rapporteur** is assigned after shortlisting (i.e., **three** panel readers in total);
    4. **Indicative workload targets per call**: typically **6–10** admitted proposals per member as **primary rapporteur** in Stage 1, and typically up to **4–6** shortlisted proposals per member as **co-rapporteur** in Stage 2.
7.  **Use for other internal competitions.** Upon decision of the Rector, the evaluation panel appointed under this Directive may also serve as the expert evaluation panel for other internal CTU competitions or programs supporting research and innovation, unless their governing documents provide otherwise.
8.  **Honoraria and reimbursements.** Where an honorarium (or other remuneration) is provided for panel work in a given Call, the **eligibility, amount/range, and payment conditions** are specified in that Call (and/or in the associated internal financial instructions).

## Article II: Roles and responsibilities

1.  **Evaluation panel**
    1.  The evaluation panel:
        1.  assesses admissible proposals and issues an **advisory recommendation**, including a ranked list, where required by the Call;
        2.  conducts interviews where required by the Call; and
        3.  adopts final recommendations based on the full evidence base (proposal, external reviews, interview outcomes where applicable).
    2.  Panel recommendations are **advisory**. Final decisions are taken by the Rector (or another body designated in the Principles/Call), taking due account of panel recommendations and available budget.
    3.  Where specified in the grant agreement, the Call, or by the Rector, the panel may provide advisory opinions on significant project changes or reporting outcomes.
2.  The **Chair** is appointed by the Rector from among panel members and:
    1.  convenes and chairs panel meetings and ensures equal treatment of proposals;
    2.  enforces confidentiality and conflict-of-interest rules;
    3.  assigns rapporteurs (and reassigns where needed);
    4.  oversees the integrity and consistency of panel deliberations and scoring; and
    5.  confirms the panel outcomes and the record of decisions on behalf of the panel.
3.  The **Vice-Chair** is appointed by the Rector from among panel members and:
    1.  supports the Chair in managing the evaluation workflow, including assignment support and quality control of evaluation records;
    2.  acts on behalf of the Chair in case of their absence; and
    3.  where the Chair is conflicted for a given proposal, chairs the relevant agenda item and ensures recusals are properly implemented.
4.  **Panel members**
    1.  evaluate proposals based on the submitted documentation and the criteria defined in the Call;
    2.  participate in discussion and (where applicable) scoring/voting, except when conflicted; and 
    3.  contribute to a consistent ranking/recommendation across the portfolio.
5.  **Rapporteur(s)**
    1. The Chair assigns **primary and co-rapporteurs** in accordance with **Article I.6**, taking into account expertise, workload balance, and conflicts of interest.
    2. The rapporteur(s) **collectively**:
        1. **prepare** a structured summary for deliberation (strengths/weaknesses versus published criteria); and
        2. **check** if external reviews are substantive and usable, and flag issues to the Chair/secretariat.
6.  **External reviewers**
    1.  External reviewers are independent experts and are, as a rule, **external to CTU**. CTU staff may be used only exceptionally (e.g., where specialized expertise is unavailable externally and no conflict of interest exists).
    2.  External reviewers provide written, criteria-based assessments using the template issued with the Call.
    3.  External reviewers assess proposals individually (they do not rank proposals) and decline the invitation if a conflict of interest exists.
7.  **Secretariat (Rectorate)**
    1.  conducts admissibility checks and organizes organizational routing to thematic areas (where used);
    2.  manages reviewer invitations, reminders, deadlines, and secure access to documents;
    3.  records panel outcomes and prepares applicant feedback according to the transparency level promised in the Call; 
    4.  maintains and develops a reviewer pool using standardized invitations and reminders; and
    5.  archives evaluation records securely.

## Article III: Core safeguards

1.  **Confidentiality and secure handling.** All proposals, reviews, scores, meeting discussions, and rankings are strictly confidential. Documents must be stored and processed only in secure environments approved by CTU.
2.  **Prohibited external tools/services.** Evaluators must not upload or share any part of an application or review content with external services that store, reuse, or train on data (including generative AI tools and online translation services).
3.  **Limited bibliographic verification.** Assessment is based primarily on evidence in the application. Evaluators must not conduct general web searches about the Principal Investigator (PI) (personal websites, social media, media coverage, etc.) or rely on informal reputation. If needed to clarify a specific output, evaluators may consult bibliographic databases (e.g., Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar).
4.  **Research integrity concerns.** Suspected scientific misconduct or serious ethical concerns must be reported to the secretariat without delay and handled under CTU procedures.
5.  **Equality, diversity, and inclusion**
    1.  Evaluators must be aware of potential unconscious bias (e.g., gender, nationality, institution, language, career path).
    2.  Productivity is interpreted relative to effective research time and documented constraints (part-time work, career breaks).
    3.  Minor language issues must not influence scientific assessment.

## Article IV: Conflicts of interest

1.  A **conflict of interest** exists whenever an external observer could reasonably suspect partiality. Evaluators must decline or recuse themselves, for example, if they:
    1.  are a named collaborator;
    2.  are in the same host unit as the PI;
    3.  have a close personal relationship with the PI;
    4.  are in a direct relationship of dependence, supervision, or strong competition; 
    5.  have closely collaborated with the PI in recent years (e.g., repeated co-authorships, joint grants, or comparable ties); or
    6.  participate in, advise on, or otherwise influence **host-unit matching or post-selection negotiations** for the PI (including drafting host-unit statements/bids, negotiating employment or implementation conditions, or participating in recruitment decisions linked to the award).
2.  Conflicts must be declared as soon as they become known. Any doubt is resolved by the Chair in consultation with the secretariat (and, if necessary, the Vice-Rector).
3.  Where a conflict is identified, the member:
    1.  does not act as rapporteur;
    2.  does not receive/access the proposal materials beyond what is strictly necessary to implement recusal;
    3.  does not participate in discussion, scoring, ranking or reporting; and
    4.  leaves the room (or disconnects) during the relevant agenda item(s).
4.  Panel members and external reviewers sign a declaration of impartiality and confidentiality once upon appointment (or first engagement) and confirm electronically for each Call that the
    declaration remains valid and that any new conflicts will be declared without delay.

## Article V: Evaluation workflow

Unless the Call states otherwise, the standard workflow is:
1.  **Stage 0**: Admissibility check and allocation
    1.  The secretariat verifies formal admissibility and completeness.
    2.  The Chair assigns each admitted proposal to the primary rapporteur.
2.  **Stage 1**: Panel assessment and shortlisting
    1.  The panel assesses proposals based on submitted documents and applies the Call criteria and scoring approach.
    2.  The panel establishes a shortlist for the next stage.
    3.  For efficiency, proposals not shortlisted may be handled in a streamlined manner (e.g., without full plenary discussion), unless a panel member requests discussion.
3.  **Stage 2**: External peer review and interview
    1. Shortlisted proposals are assigned co-rapporteur(s) in accordance with **Article I.6** and sent to external reviewer(s) as specified in the Call.
    2. If interviews are part of the Call, interviews are structured and follow a standard format defined in the Call to ensure equal treatment.
4.  **Stage 3**: Final deliberation, ranking, and recommendations
    1.  The panel considers the full evidence base (proposal, external reviews, and interview outcomes where applicable).
    2.  The panel adopts a final ranking and funding recommendation (including a reserve list where relevant).

## Article VI: Conduct of deliberations, meetings, and documentation

1.  **Modes of work.** The panel conducts its work through panel meetings (remote or in-person) and written procedures, including electronic evaluation and voting ("per rollam"), as permitted by the Call and this Directive.
2.  **Non-public meetings.** Panel meetings are not public. Only panel members, authorised staff of the Rectorate and invited guests (e.g.,
    legal/integrity support) may attend.
3.  **Quorum and decisions.**
    1.  The panel is quorate if more than half of all voting members are present (physically or remotely).
    2.  A member recused due to conflict of interest is not counted towards quorum for the relevant agenda item(s).
    3.  Decisions are taken by consensus where possible; otherwise by simple majority of votes of non-conflicted members.
4.  **Per rollam procedure.** Where needed (e.g., scheduling constraints), the Chair may complete decision-making via a written per rollam procedure. The secretariat ensures that:
    1.  voting materials and draft outcomes are distributed securely;
    2.  the voting window is stated clearly; and
    3.  the outcome is recorded in the record of decisions.
5.  **Sequence for each proposal (standard meeting conduct).**
    1.  Presentation: the rapporteur summarizes the proposal and key review points.
    2.  Discussion: members discuss strengths and weaknesses with reference to the published criteria.
    3.  Scoring and ranking: the panel records the main reasons for the outcome in a form suitable for applicant feedback following the Call.
6.  **Record of decisions and verification.**
    1.  The secretariat prepares a record of decisions for each meeting (or written procedure), including attendance, recusals, and adopted outcomes (including rankings where applicable).
    2.  The record is confirmed by the Chair.
7.  **External expertise.** Where necessary, the Chair (in consultation with the secretariat) may invite external reviewers or ad-hoc experts to provide written reviews or attend part of a meeting. External experts do not have voting rights and are bound by the same conflict-of-interest and confidentiality obligations.
8.  **Records and feedback.**
    1.  The secretariat archives reviews and panel records securely.
    2.  Applicants receive feedback consistent with the transparency level promised in the Call.
    3.  Procedural objections are handled as described in the Principles and the Call.

## Article VII:Composition, appointment and term of office
1.  The evaluation panel consists of recognized experts in relevant disciplines, ensuring broad coverage of the Competition scope. As a rule, the panel includes members external to CTU and, where
    feasible, international representation.
2.  Panel size is determined by the Rector with a view to ensuring both broad expertise and manageable workload. As a rule, the panel has **7–13 voting members**.
3.  Panel members are appointed by the Rector, usually upon proposal of the Vice-Rector for Science, Creative Activity, and Doctoral Studies (or equivalent Vice-Rector designated by the Rector). To minimize administrative burden, nominations are collected and prepared by the Rectorate through targeted invitations and/or an open nomination window.
4.  The term of office of a panel member is **four years** and may be renewed at most once consecutively, unless the Rector decides otherwise in justified cases. Terms may be staggered to ensure
    continuity.
5.  Membership in the evaluation panel is incompatible with acting as a PI in the Competition in the relevant Call. A PI may not, at the time of submission, be a member of the evaluation panel appointed for that Call. A panel member who intends to submit a proposal must resign from the panel before submission.
6.  Membership in the panel ends:
    1.  upon expiry of the term of office;
    2.  at the written request (resignation) of the member;
    3.  by decision of the Rector in case of serious or repeated breach of duties; or
    4.  if the member is no longer able to fulfil the role.
7.  The Rectorate may maintain a reserve pool of alternates and ad-hoc experts who may be invited when needed (e.g., to address specific sub-fields or to replace members who must be recused).

## Article VIII: Final provisions

1.  The Vice-Rector for Science, Creative Activity, and Doctoral Studies (or equivalent Vice-Rector designated by the Rector) may issue **Standard Operating Procedures** consistent with this Directive (e.g., templates, deadlines, communication scripts, IT instructions).
